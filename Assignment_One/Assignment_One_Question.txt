Project One Question:

Find a public dataset that is suitable for supervised machine learning.
Train several machine learning models based on the dataset. Assess how well each model performs using one or more quantitative metrics.
Include an analysis of your work with Matplotlib graphs and your own commentary.
Perform both the programming and the description of the steps in a single Jupyter notebook (using cells for “Code” and “Markdown” respectively). Submit the notebook along with the chosen dataset in Blackboard.
